    --This module contains some options that allows you to choose which mazes you''re
    playing [Only option at the moment is USA, but there is the possibility of hosting
    other landmasses in the future] and change the way you interact with the module.


    You can choose to play in Standard mode, where the shown state changes along with
    your button presses, or you can play in Memory mode, where the visuals do not
    change and you must keep track of the buttons you''re pressing. Standard mode
    is enabled by default.'
